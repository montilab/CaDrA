Description: Performs both stepwise and backward heuristic search for 
    candidate (epi)genetic drivers based on a binary multi-omics dataset. 
    CaDrA's main objective is to identify features which, together, are 
    significantly skewed or enriched pertaining to a given vector of 
    continuous scores (e.g. sample-specific scores representing a phenotypic 
    readout of interest, such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.), 
    based on the union occurence (i.e. logical OR) of the events.
