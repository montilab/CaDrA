\arguments{
\item{FS}{a matrix of binary features or a SummarizedExperiment class object 
from SummarizedExperiment package where rows represent features of interest 
(e.g. genes, transcripts, exons, etc...) and columns represent the samples. 
The assay of FS contains binary (1/0) values indicating the presence/absence 
of omics features.}

\item{input_score}{a vector of continuous scores representing a phenotypic
readout of interest such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.

NOTE: \code{input_score} object must have names or labels that match the 
column names of \code{FS} object.}

\item{method}{a character string specifies a scoring method that is
used in the search. There are 6 options: (\code{"ks_pval"} or \code{ks_score}
or \code{"wilcox_pval"} or \code{wilcox_score} or 
\code{"revealer"} (conditional mutual information from REVEALER) or
\code{"custom"} (a customized scoring method)). 
Default is \code{ks_pval}.}

\item{custom_function}{if method is \code{"custom"}, specifies
the name of the customized function here. Default is \code{NULL}.

NOTE: \code{custom_function} must take FS_mat (or FS) and input_score as its
input arguments, and its final result must return a vector of row-wise scores 
ordered from most significant to least significant where its labels or names 
matched the row names of FS_mat (or FS) object.}

\item{custom_parameters}{if method is \code{"custom"}, specifies a list of
additional arguments (excluding \code{FS_mat} (or FS) and \code{input_score}) 
to be passed to the \code{custom_function}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifies an alternative hypothesis
testing (\code{"two.sided"} or \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}).
Default is \code{less} for left-skewed significance testing.

NOTE: This argument is ONLY applied to KS and Wilcoxon method}

\item{weights}{if method is \code{ks_score} or \code{ks_pval}, specifying a 
vector of weights will perform a weighted-KS testing. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{search_start}{a list of character strings (separated by commas)
which specifies feature names within the FS object to start
the search with. If \code{search_start} is provided, then \code{top_N}
parameter will be ignored. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{top_N}{an integer specifies the number of features to start the
search over, starting from the top 'N' features in each case. If \code{top_N}
is provided, then \code{search_start} parameter will be ignored. Default is
\code{1}.}

\item{search_method}{a character string specifies an algorithm to filter
out the best features (\code{"forward"} or \code{"both"}). Default is
\code{both} (i.e. backward and forward).}

\item{max_size}{an integer specifies a maximum size that a meta-feature
can extend to do for a given search. Default is \code{7}.}

\item{best_score_only}{a logical value indicates whether or not to return 
the best score corresponding to each top N searches ONLY.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{do_plot}{a logical value indicates whether or not to plot the
overlapping features of the resulting meta-feature matrix. 

NOTE: plot can only be produced if the resulting meta-feature matrix contains 
more than 1 feature (e.g. length(search_start) > 1 or top_N > 1). 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{do_check}{a logical value indicates whether or not to validate if the
given parameters (FS and input_score) are valid inputs. 
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{a logical value indicates whether or not to print the
diagnostic messages. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{best_score_only = TRUE}, the heuristic search will return 
the best feature whose its union meta-feature matrix has the highest score 
among the \code{top_N} feature searches.
If \code{best_score_only = FALSE}, a list of objects pertaining to 
\code{top_N} feature searches are returned. For each top_N feature search,
the candidate search will contain 3 objects: (1) its best meta-feature matrix 
(\code{feature_set}), (2) its observed input scores (\code{input_score}), 
and lastly, its corresponding best score pertaining to the union meta-feature
matrix (\code{score}).
}
\description{
Performs heuristic search on a set of binary features to determine whether
there are features whose union is more skewed (enriched at the extremes)
than either features alone. This is the main functionality of 
the \code{CaDrA} package.
}
\details{
NOTE: The legacy function \code{topn_eval} is equivalent to the recommended
\code{candidate_search} function
