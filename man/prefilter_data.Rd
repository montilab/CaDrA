\title{Pre-filter features}
\usage{
prefilter_data(FS, max_cutoff = 0.6, min_cutoff = 0.03, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{FS}{a SummarizedExperiment object containing binary features where
rows represent features of interest (e.g. genes, transcripts, exons, etc.)
and columns represent the samples.}

\item{max_cutoff}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 describing the absolute
prevalence of a feature across all samples in the FS object which the
feature will be filtered out. Default is 0.6 (feature that occur in
60 percent or more of the samples will be removed)}

\item{min_cutoff}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 describing the absolute
prevalence of a feature across all samples in the FS object which the
feature will be filtered out. Default is 0.03 (feature that occur in
3 percent or less of the samples will be removed)}

\item{verbose}{a logical value indicates whether or not to print the
diagnostic messages. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with only the filtered-in features
given the filtered thresholds
}
\description{
Pre-filter a dataset prior running \code{candidate_search} to avoid
testing features that are too prevalent or too sparse across samples in
the dataset
}
\examples{

# Load pre-computed feature set
data(sim_FS)

# Filter out features having < 3\% and > 60\% prevalence across all samples
# by (default)
sim_FS_filt1 <- prefilter_data(FS = sim_FS)

# Change the min cut-off to 1\% prevalence, instead of the default of 3\%
sim_FS_filt2 <- prefilter_data(FS = sim_FS, min_cutoff  = 0.01)

# Change the max cut-off to 65\% prevalence, instead of the default of 60\%
sim_FS_filt3 <- prefilter_data(FS = sim_FS, max_cutoff = 0.65)
