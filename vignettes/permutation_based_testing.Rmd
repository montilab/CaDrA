**CaDrA** implements a forward/backward search algorithm to look for a subset of features whose union is maximally associated with an outcome of interest, based on (currently) one of four scoring functions (**Kolmogorov-Smirnov**, **Conditional Mutual Information**, **Wilcoxon**, and **custom-defined**). To test whether the strength of the association between the set of features and the observed input scores (e.g., pathway activity, drug sensitivity, etc.) is greater than it would be expected by chance, **CaDrA** supports permutation-based significance testing. Importantly, the permutation test iterates over the entire search procedure (e.g., if `top_N = 7`, each permutation iteration will consist of running the search over the top 7 features).

# Load packages

```r
library(CaDrA)
```

# Load required datasets

1. A `binary features matrix` also known as `Feature Set` (such as somatic mutations, copy number alterations, chromosomal translocations, etc.) The 1/0 row vectors indicate the presence/absence of ‘omics’ features in the samples. The `Feature Set` must be an object of class **SummarizedExperiment** from **SummarizedExperiment** package) 
2. A vector of continuous scores (or `input_score`) representing a functional response of interest (such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.)

```{r load.data}

# Load pre-simulated feature set 
# See ?sim_FS for more information
data(sim_FS)

# Load pre-computed input-score
# See ?sim_Scores for more information
data(sim_Scores)

```

# Find a subset of features that maximally associated with a given outcome of interest

Here we are using **Kolmogorow-Smirnow** (KS) scoring method to search for best features

```{r ks.method}

ks_candidate <- CaDrA::candidate_search(
  FS = sim_FS,
  input_score = sim_Scores,
  method = "ks_pval",          # Use Kolmogorow-Smirnow scoring function 
  alternative = "less",        # Use one-sided hypothesis testing
  weight = NULL,               # If weight is provided, perform a weighted-KS test
  search_method = "both",      # Apply both forward and backward search
  top_N = 7,                   # Number of top features to kick start the search
  max_size = 10,               # Allow at most 10 features in meta-feature matrix
  best_score_only = FALSE      # Return meta-feature, its observed input scores and corresponding best score
)

```

# Visualize best meta-features result

```{r ks.meta.plot}

# Extract the best meta-feature result
topn_best_meta <- topn_best(topn_list = ks_candidate)

# Visualize meta-feature result
meta_plot(topn_best_list = topn_best_meta)

```

# Permutation-based testing

```r

ks_perm_res <- CaDrA::CaDrA(
  FS = sim_FS, 
  input_score = sim_Scores, 
  method = "ks_pval",          # Use Kolmogorow-Smirnow scoring function 
  weight = NULL,               # If weight is provided, perform a weighted-KS test
  alternative = "less",        # Use one-sided hypothesis testing
  search_method = "both",      # Apply both forward and backward search
  top_N = 7,                   # Repeat the search with the top N features
  max_size = 10,               # Allow at most 10 features in the meta-feature matrix
  n_perm = 1000,               # Number of permutations
  plot = FALSE,                # We will plot later
  ncores = 1                   # Number of cores to perform parallelization
)
