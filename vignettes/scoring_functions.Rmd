The **CaDrA** package currently provides four scoring functions to search for subsets of genomic features that are likely associated with a specific outcome of interest (e.g., protein expression, pathway activity, etc.)

1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Method (`ks`)
2. Conditional Mutual Information Method (`revealer`)
3. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Method (`wilcox`)
4. Custom - An User's Provided Scoring Function (`custom`)

Below, we run `candidate_search()` over the top 3 starting features using each of the four scoring functions described above.

**Important Note:**

- The legacy function `topn_eval()` is equivalent to the recommended `candidate_search()` function

# Load packages

```r
library(CaDrA)
```

# Load required datasets

1. A `binary features matrix` also known as `Feature Set` (such as somatic mutations, copy number alterations, chromosomal translocations, etc.) The 1/0 row vectors indicate the presence/absence of ‘omics’ features in the samples. The `Feature Set` must be an object of class **SummarizedExperiment** from **SummarizedExperiment** package) 
2. A vector of continuous scores (or `input_score`) representing a functional response of interest (such as protein expression, pathway activity, etc.)

```{r load.data}

# Load pre-computed feature set
data(sim_FS)
 
# Load pre-computed input scores
data(sim_Scores)

```

# Kolmogorov-Smirnov scoring method 

See `?ks_rowscore` for more details

```{r ks.method}

  FS = sim_FS,
  input_score = sim_Scores,
  method = "ks_pval",          # Use Kolmogorow-Smirnow scoring function 
  weights = NULL,              # If weights is provided, perform a weighted-KS test
  alternative = "less",        # Use one-sided hypothesis testing
  search_method = "both",      # Apply both forward and backward search
  top_N = 3,                   # Evaluate top 3 starting points for the search
  max_size = 7,                # Allow at most 7 features in meta-feature matrix
  do_plot = FALSE,             # We will plot it AFTER finding the best hits
  best_score_only = FALSE      # Return meta-feature, its observed input scores and corresponding best score
)

# Now we can fetch the feature set of top N features that corresponded to the best scores over the top N search
ks_topn_best_meta <- topn_best(ks_topn_l)

# Visualize best meta-feature result

# Conditional Mutual Information scoring method 

See `?revealer_rowscore` for more details

```{r revealer.method}
